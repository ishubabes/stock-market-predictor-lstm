## üöÄ Features

### ‚úÖ Historical Stock Analysis
- Fetches 10 years of historical stock data via [`yfinance`](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/).
- Calculates daily price changes and classifies movement (up/down).
- Creates a target variable for binary classification (1 = BUY, 0 = SELL/HOLD).

### ‚úÖ Machine Learning Models
Trains and evaluates the following models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model:
- Uses standardized features (`Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`).
- Outputs an accuracy score and classification report.
- Predicts the next move using the latest market data.

### ‚úÖ Market Capitalization Analysis
- Retrieves live market capitalization for top stocks (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, etc.).
- Computes weightage of each stock in a sample market portfolio.
- Displays weights using a pie chart.

### ‚úÖ Visualizations
- Pie chart of stock weights based on market capitalization.
- Bar chart comparing model accuracy for different stocks.
